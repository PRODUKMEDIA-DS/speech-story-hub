          Our Mission
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          This website was created to help 5th grade students learn about direct and indirect 
          speech in a fun and interactive way. We believe that learning grammar doesn't have to 
          be boring - it can be an adventure!
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Through colorful comics, interactive exercises, and clear explanations, we aim to make 
          this important grammar concept easy to understand and remember. Just like books are 
          windows to the world, understanding speech helps us communicate better with everyone 
          around us! üåç
